I can resume all this learning experience as "Discipline". Motivation makes you start discipline moves you to the end.

## Training per Area

What you will see below is a list of training I did to support my professional life as an Information technology Project Manager. When you work as a consultant in the enterprise is important to know about the best practices in IT Governance, Project Management and the trending technologies.

Not to micromanage but to see with others can't. Proactively avoiding problems and mitigating risks. "You can't control what you can't measure" -- Tom DeMarco.

```{r}
theme_set(
  theme_bw()+
  # theme_grey() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          axis.title.y = element_blank(),
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  ))

Pal_Seq_Blue_6 = c("#f1eef6","#bdc9e1","#74a9cf","#2b8cbe","#045a8d")
```

```{r}
GA<- Training %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(Area))) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_infreq(Area)),
          stat = "count") +
 ggtitle("Training") +
 xlab("Number of Courses") +
 scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues", direction = -1 ) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") 

ggplotly(GA) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
  # config(modeBarButtonsToRemove = c("zoomIn2d", "zoomOut2d"))
```

## Information Technology Governance

Know IT Governance is important to feel the context we are inserted. Projects must be Planned, Executed, Controlled and Closed with this in mind. At the end the project must fit in the Governance in place considering, people, polices and frameworks, processes, organizational structures, culture, ethics and behavior, information, services, Infrastructure and applications.

```{r}
# Filtering Training by Area
Governance <- Training %>%
  filter( Area == "IT Governance") %>%
  arrange(Skills, Course,"Date", descending = TRUE) %>%
  select(Course, Skills,'Date', Company)
```

```{r}
GA<- Governance %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(Skills))) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_infreq(Skills)),
          stat = "count") +
 ggtitle("IT Governance Training") +
 xlab("Number of Courses") +
 scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Purples", direction = -1 ) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") 

ggplotly(GA) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Building a Table 
Governance %>% datatable(class = 'cell-border stripe',filter = "top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 10),
          caption = htmltools::tags$caption( 
            style = 'caption-side: top;
                     text-align: center;
                     color:black;
                     font-size:200% ;',
            'IT Governance Training'))
```

## Project Management

Project Management is about Servant Leadership it means be open to do your best to remove any impediments we as a team have to deliver the outcome.

The best practices like **PRINCE2**, **PMBOK**, and agile practices like **Scrum**, **Kanban** must be known. Keep in mind we are free to adapt and improve to our own needs. "Methodologies are treks not rails" - Joao Luiz D'Andrea

```{r}
ProjectManagement <- Training %>%
  filter( Area == "Project Management") %>%
  arrange(Skills,Technology,Course,"Date", descending = TRUE) %>%
  select(Course, Skills, 'Date', Company)
```

```{r}
GA<- ProjectManagement %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(Skills))) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_infreq(Skills)),
          stat = "count") +
 ggtitle("Project Management Training") +
 xlab("Number of Courses") +
 scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues", direction = -1 ) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") 

ggplotly(GA) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ProjectManagement %>% datatable(class = 'cell-border stripe',filter = "top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 50),
          caption = htmltools::tags$caption( 
          style = 'caption-side: top;                                                                           text-align: center;                                                                          color:black;
                   font-size:200%;
          ','Project Management Training'))
```

## Information Technology and Data Science Training

### Information Technology

I love technology and how affect the business and our day-by-day activities and change the world. That was my motivation when I started my way in IT.

Update with the new releases of ERP and CRM Software like SAP, Sales-force, Microsoft Dynamics 365.

It has been a life learning endeavour to keep up to date and have a deep understand of new technologies in special in the last ten year when infrastructure enable **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Block Chain** and the **Cloud** movement. In the table below we can see my effort in that direction learning: **Spark** (Spark SQL, Spark Graph-X, Spark ML, Spark Streaming), **Hadoop**, Ambary, HDFS, Map Reduce, Pig, Hive, Drill, Phoenix, Presto, Yarn, Messos, Zookeeper, Oozy, Zeppelin, Hue, **NIFI**,**Kafka**, Flume, Sqoop, Node-Red. No Relational Databases: **Hbase**, **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**.

```{r}
IT <- Training %>%
  filter(Area == "Information technology") %>% 
  arrange(Skills,Technology,Course,"Date", descending = FALSE) %>%
  select(Course, Skills, Technology,'Date',Company)
```

```{r}
IT %>% datatable(class = 'cell-border stripe',filter = "top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 50),
          caption = htmltools::tags$caption( 
          style = 'caption-side: top;
                   text-align: center;
                   color:black;
                   font-size:200%;', 'Information Technology Training')) 
```

Training by Skill

```{r}
GA<- IT %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(Skills))) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_infreq(Skills)),
              stat = "count") +
 ggtitle("Training by IT Skill") +
 xlab("Number of Courses") +
 scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") 

ggplotly(GA) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

Training by Technology

```{r}
GA<- IT %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(Technology))) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_infreq(Technology)),
          stat = "count") +
 ggtitle("Training by Technology") +
 xlab("Number of Courses") +

  select(Course, Skills, Technology, 'Date', Company)
```

```{r}
DataScience %>% datatable(class = 'cell-border stripe',filter = "top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 50, autoWidth = TRUE),
          caption = htmltools::tags$caption( 
          style = 'caption-side: top;
                   text-align: center;
                   color:black;
                   font-size:200% ;                                                      '                      ,'Data Science & Big Data Training')) 
```

```{r}

## Business & Management

This is a couple of training in Business and Management like Marketing, Sales, Productivity, Team Building and related soft skills.

  filter( Area == "Business") %>%
  arrange(Skills,Course,"Date", descending = TRUE) %>%
  select(Course, Skills, 'Date', Company,)
```

```{r}
GA<- Business %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(Skills))) +
 geom_bar(aes(fill = fct_infreq(Skills)),
          stat = "count") +
 ggtitle("Business Training") +
 xlab("Number of Courses") +
 scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") 

ggplotly(GA) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

```{r}
Business %>% datatable(class = 'cell-border stripe',filter = "top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 50, autoWidth = TRUE),
          caption = htmltools::tags$caption( 
          style = 'caption-side: top;
                   text-align: center;
                   color:black;
                   font-size:200%;' ,'Business and Management')) 
```
